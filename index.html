                    I am born and raised in South Africa , devoted my whole life to Christ and His
                    teachings and also served
                    as a branch secretary and Elders Quorum Secretary.I am a certified Analytical laboratory
                    Technician,
                    who wants to obtain a degree in programming.I have three lovely children, two daughters and
                    a
                    son.
                    My wife always by my side and more then just my life partner,whom I am fully devoted with.
                    I love spending time on pc`s if it`s upgrading them or fixing them and one of my best
                    hobbies is
                    online Gaming.I also love playing piano and that is the reason why I am pursuing a career in
                    coding
                    and programming.
                    I have been very sick and was admitted to hospital as a baby every year, but through the
                    grace
                    and
                    power of the Melchezideck priesthood and the faith of my parents I was healed and today I
                    have
                    that
                    same
                    priesthood Power.God blessed me to baptise my wife, son and daughters and blessed them as
                    babies.
                    I testify that nothing is more powerfull than a priesthood blessing through the power of the
                    Holy
                    Ghost
                    except God and Jesus Christ.
